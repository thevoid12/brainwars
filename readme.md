How Redis Solves the Problem
Imagine you're running two app instances:

Instance A
Instance B
If Player 1 connects to Instance A and Player 2 connects to Instance B, they both belong to the same quiz room.

With Go in-memory maps:

Instance A wouldn't know about Player 2.
Instance B wouldn't know about Player 1.
The game would break.
With Redis:

Both instances would subscribe to the same Redis Pub/Sub channel for the room.
Each message would be broadcasted via Redis and delivered to both instances.
Both players would stay in sync â€” as if they were on the same server.
