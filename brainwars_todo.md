## security checklist
Here is a **step-by-step checklist** to make your frontend (HTML + Go + HTMX + Gin) code as secure as practically possible against frontend attacks like **XSS**, **CSRF**, **Clickjacking**, and other common web threats. While nothing is ever **100% secure**, following these steps gives you **best-in-class protection**.

## ‚úÖ Frontend Security Checklist (HTMX + Go + Gin)

---

### üîê 1. **Sanitize All Dynamic Data**

| Step | What to Do                                                                                           | Notes                                                                                                  |                             |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1.1  | Use Go‚Äôs `html/template` (not `text/template`)                                                       | Ensures automatic HTML escaping                                                                        |                             |
| 1.2  | Never use \`{{ .                                                                                     | safeHTML }}\` unless using a sanitizer (e.g. [bluemonday](https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday)) | Prevents raw HTML injection |
| 1.3  | For JSON in attributes (like `data-hx-headers`), use `template.JS` and manually construct valid JSON | Prevents script context issues                                                                         |                             |

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 2. **CSRF Protection (HTMX-Compatible)**

| Step | What to Do                                                                                    | Notes                                        |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 2.1  | Generate a per-session CSRF token and store in `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie | Use `c.SetCookie(...)` in Gin                |
| 2.2  | Echo token in a meta tag or `data-hx-headers` (you are doing this)                            | Use Go's `template.JS` to safely encode JSON |
| 2.3  | Validate CSRF token on each unsafe request (`POST`, `PUT`, etc.) server-side                  | Use middleware or per-route validation       |

---

### üîí 3. **Set Critical HTTP Security Headers**

Set these in middleware in Gin:

```go
func SecureHeaders() gin.HandlerFunc {
    return func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.Header("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload")
        c.Header("Content-Security-Policy", "default-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none';")
        c.Header("X-Frame-Options", "DENY")
        c.Header("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff")
        c.Header("Referrer-Policy", "strict-origin-when-cross-origin")
        c.Header("Permissions-Policy", "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()")
        c.Next()
    }
}
```

Apply it:

```go
r := gin.Default()
r.Use(SecureHeaders())
```

---

### üß± 4. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**

| Step | What to Do                                         | Notes                                                      |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4.1  | Disallow inline scripts unless using a nonce       | Helps mitigate XSS                                         |
| 4.2  | Only allow scripts and styles from trusted sources | Use `'self'` and `nonce-<value>` or external files         |
| 4.3  | Avoid `unsafe-inline`                              | Consider `strict-dynamic` with nonce for Alpine.js or HTMX |

Example (strong CSP):

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none';
```

---

### üß™ 5. **Input Validation & Output Escaping**

| Step | What to Do                                             | Notes                                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5.1  | Sanitize or validate all user input on the server side | Use strong schema validation                                    |
| 5.2  | Escape output based on context (HTML, JS, JSON, URLs)  | Go templates help here, but be cautious with embedded JS or CSS |

---

### üß¨ 6. **Session and Cookie Hygiene**

| Step | What to Do                                             | Notes                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 6.1  | Set cookies as `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` | Prevents theft via XSS/CSRF  |
| 6.2  | Rotate session IDs after login/logout                  | Prevents session fixation    |
| 6.3  | Store minimal session data client-side                 | Avoid leaking sensitive data |

---

### üßØ 7. **Clickjacking Protection**

Set one of:

```http
X-Frame-Options: DENY
# or, better:
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';
```

---

### üîç 8. **Audit Static Files & External Dependencies**

| Step | What to Do                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 8.1  | Serve JS/CSS locally (don‚Äôt use CDNs without integrity checks) | Prevent supply-chain attacks                                 |
| 8.2  | Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) if you must load from CDN      | `<script src="..." integrity="..." crossorigin="anonymous">` |
| 8.3  | Periodically audit npm/pnpm packages for vulnerabilities       | `npm audit`, `osv.dev`, etc.                                 |

---

### üßº 9. **Disable Unnecessary Browser Features**

Use `Permissions-Policy` to lock down:

```http
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), usb=()
```

---

### üìú 10. **Limit Error Information in HTML**

| Step | What to Do                                          | Notes                      |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 10.1 | Do not show stack traces or internal errors in HTML | Show user-friendly message |
| 10.2 | Log details server-side                             | Secure logs from tampering |

---

### ‚úÖ Final Sanity Checks

* [ ] HTTPS is enabled everywhere (force-redirect HTTP to HTTPS)
* [ ] Static assets have appropriate cache headers (`Cache-Control`)
* [ ] All user-generated content is validated and sanitized
* [ ] Server-side logs are monitored and stored securely
* [ ] Rate limiting or CAPTCHA is applied to sensitive endpoints
